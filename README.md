##  Explain the purpose of the analysis.
### Create different models using different methods, to make predictions on healthy loan vs. high-risk-loan. Compare these models on accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score to choose the model which works best for this case.

## Summarize the results from the machine learning model.
### Overall, all models perform good predictions with high accuracy score, precision score, and recall score. However, logistic regression is outstanding, it’s precision score is good enough comparing to other models’, but it’s recall score outperformed, which means logistic regression is more able to capture positive instances than other models while it keeps a high precision level as others do.
